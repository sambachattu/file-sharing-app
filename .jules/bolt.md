## 2024-05-18 - First Optimization Hunt
**Learning:** Understanding the frontend React codebase to find optimization opportunities.
**Action:** Identified `FileList.js` rendering a list of files that could benefit from virtualization or memoization, and `formatFileSize` / `getFileIcon` being re-computed on every render.

## 2024-05-18 - Backend Optimization Hunt
**Learning:** Evaluated `file_service.go`. The internal storage is a map mapping ID to *File. In `GetFileByFilename` and `DeleteFile`, the code does an O(N) scan over the map to find the file by filename. Since the ID doesn't seem strictly necessary as a lookup key for the map (only `filename` is ever used to query or delete, except for `id` inside the struct), this O(N) scan could be O(1) if we either store a secondary map of filename -> id or simply use filename as the key. Wait, looking at `GetFileByFilename` and `DeleteFile`, `filename` is unique per file (it's a UUID).
**Action:** Change `FileService.files` to map `filename` instead of `ID` or add an index map.

## 2024-05-18 - Unnecessary React Component Unmounting Anti-Pattern
**Learning:** Found a common performance bottleneck in `App.js` where a single `loading` state was used to replace the entire `FileList` component with a loading indicator. This approach completely unmounts the `FileList` (and all its children) on every background fetch (e.g., after upload or deletion), causing massive DOM destruction and recreation.
**Action:** Always conditionally render loading states so that existing lists/components are preserved (e.g., `loading && files.length === 0` for full replacement, and a subtle overlay/indicator for background refetches). Additionally, extracted inner utility functions from `FileList.js` to avoid re-creation on every render.

## 2024-05-18 - React List Rendering with Primitive Destructuring
**Learning:** Found a performance pattern in React when rendering lists from backend refetches. Background polling/fetching recreates all objects in an array. If we pass the full object to a memoized child list item, it will break memoization because object references are new. But a custom comparator that only checks the ID is dangerous since it hides metadata updates from the backend (like status changes).
**Action:** The safe way to solve this is to extract list items into a component wrapped in `React.memo` AND destructure the file object in the parent mapping function, passing only primitive properties to the child list item. This uses React.memo's default shallow comparison on primitives, which correctly preserves memoization and safely re-renders if backend metadata changes.
